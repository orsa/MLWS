In this folder you will find the two basic files required for game log parsing.
In order to implement  a log parser, you will need to:
	1. Create a class that extends edu.umich.eecs.tac.Parser. (In our example, that will be the tau.tac.adx.parser.GeneralParser class.)
	2. In it, you will override the inherited (protected void message(int sender, int receiver, Transportable content)) method.
	   This methods will be called for each message in the log file, according to the order that they were sent in the game.
	   The first parameter indicates where the message originated from.
	   The second parameter indicates the desired recipient for the message.
	   An the third one will be the message itself.
	3. There are two main types of messages:
		A. Regular messages - (such as AdNetworkDailyNotification)
								Contain simple data, with getter methods.
		B. Complex messages - (such as CampaignReport)
								Contain a mapping between keys and values. In the CampaignReport example, the keys will be the
								campaign id (encapsulated by CampaignReportKey), and the values will be the campaign report (encapsulated by CampaignReportEntry).
	4. To keep track of the current day (of which all following messages relate to), you can extract it from the SimulationStatus message (getCurrentDate() method).
	5. After you have a new class, you will need to create an instance of it in a new class, extending se.sics.tasim.logtool.LogHandler (See GeneralHandler for reference).
	6. And finally, edit the runLogParser.sh and replace the handler class from tau.tac.adx.parser.GeneralHandler to your class.
	
An example for parsing messages is included in the GeneralParser.java file.
It parses several messages:
	Regular - AdNetworkDailyNotification and BankStatus
	Copmlex - CampaignReport and AdNetworkReport
	Simulation - SimulationStatus (Regular message sent from the simulation)
